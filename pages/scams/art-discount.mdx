# Art Discount

## How it works
1. You receive a message from someone claiming to be an artist
2. They offer you a discount on their art
3. They ask for payment in advance
4. You pay them and never receive the art

## I've already fallen for this scam
1. Contact your bank and ask them to reverse the payment
2. Report the scam to [Discord Trust & Safety](https://dis.gd/request)
3. Block the scammer

## How do I avoid this scam?
- Never pay for art in advance
- Always ask for a portfolio of the artist's work
  - If they claim to be a professional, they should have a portfolio
- If you're unsure, ask for references from previous clients
