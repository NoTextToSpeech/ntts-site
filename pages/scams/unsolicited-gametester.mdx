# Unsolicited Game Tester

## How it works
1. You receive an email or message from someone claiming to be a game tester for a popular game
2. They claim to have access to the game's source code and can give you early access to the game
3. They send you a ZIP file of the game, which contains malware
4. You extract the file and enter the password they provide
5. Your computer is infected with malware

## I've already fallen for this scam
1. Uninstall the game
2. Run a full antivirus scan on your computer
3. Change your passwords

## How do I avoid this scam?
- Never download files from unsolicited emails or messages
- Be cautious of any email or message that claims to give you early access to a game
- Always verify the source of the email or message
- Be very suspicious of files that require a password to open
